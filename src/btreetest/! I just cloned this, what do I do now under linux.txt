Step 1) Check you have cmake version 3.1 or above installed by calling this command line:

cmake --version

Step 2) In this directory, run one of the following commands:

... to build binaries

make debug							- builds regression test binary with debug flags
make profile						- builds regression test binary with profile flags (resulting binary is supposed to be used with a profiler)
make release						- builds regression test binary with release flags
make coverage						- builds regression test binary with debug and coverage flags

... to run tests in bulk

make regression						- runs regression tests using debug binary (this may takes hours to complete)
make coverage_report				- runs regression tests using coverage binary and creates result displayed as HTML (this may takes hours to complete)

... to clean up

make clean_all						- runs any clean commands
make clean							- removes any build file (may those be intermediate or final)
make clean_regression_tests			- cleans all regression tests regardless of their result
make clean_failed_regression_tests	- cleans all regression tests that returned with an error code

Step 3) run the test bench directly

Depending on what binary has been build, use one of the following command lines to see what individual tests can be run:

./btreetest_dbg --help
./btreetest_prf --help
./btreetest --help

Examples:

./btreetest.dbg -type stl-multimap test 1000

./btreetest.dbg -type array test 1


Note: Don't run cmake directly, since this will destroy the existing Makefile. In case that happened anyway, then run the ./recover_makefile.sh script or execute the following commands:

rm -fv CMakeCache.txt
rm -rfv CMakeFiles
cp -fv Makefile.backup Makefile

Usual indicators that the Makefile got destroyed are, that make complains about a rule not to exist or that it cannot find a file.


Note: This is the btree-framework test bench. If you want to see the btree-framework source code, then go to directory btree_framework. If you want to get hold of btree-framework source code as a sub-module to build a library, then run this commands:

cd .../to/your/project's/location
git clone https://github.com/andreas-steffens/btree-framework
